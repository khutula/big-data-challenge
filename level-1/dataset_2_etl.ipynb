They were together then not together, together and then not, over and over again. Like a tennis match, it was entertaining at times, but was nerve racking and tiring to watch. Yet, I couldn't stop reading. Although it was painful to witness, I did like the dilemma Callum found himself in when the woman who had shattered his heart suddenly came back to him and  wanted him back.  He was caught between that proverbial rock  and  a hard place and was forced to make an impossibly tough choice. But, just like in a tennis match, in order for Callum to win in Love, he had to put himself out there, face his opponent head on with everything he had, and fight to win.

This was Quince and Joy's Story. Quince took over the Pride after it had been corrupted by Lex. Quince was strong, loyal, charming, determined. He was determined to mate with Joy, he knew they were mates. Joy just kept avoiding him. The chemistry between them was through the roof. I laughed out loud numerous times at his tactics in getting Joy's attention. Joy was strong-willed, funny, determined, and didn't take anything off anybody. Joy and Quince had to work out their issues while dealing with some of Lex' s followers that wanted to cause trouble. By the Tail was funny, heartwarming, hot and steamy with added action. This was a great book, just like the rest of the Courgar Falls Series. I highly recommend. I received an ARC copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.

She is weak and written to be quite pathetic.  How she can so quickly fall in love with a cruel man (and he is cruel and rude until about 3/4 of the way through) is beyond me.  I was rooting for the villain to do away with them both.  I read some of the dialogue between the two love interests to my husband and we laughed at its absurdity.<br /><br />The writing style was very good but the plot and characters were not endearing in any way.  I would have rather had the female character just play along, quietly until she could return to her time instead of simpering and desperate.  This, to me, was not a romance but a twisted Stockholm syndrome fiction.<br /><br />Spend your money elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                            |2013-09-09 |\n","|US         |44803855   |R3MCA5W3BZ65OU|B008J4RPWA|804503161     |Summerset Abbey: A Bloom in Winter                                   |Digital_Ebook_Purchase|5          |0            |0          |N   |Y                |#2, just as good as #1!!   |I love the interaction of the 3 &#34;sisters&#34;.
